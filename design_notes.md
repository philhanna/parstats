## Setup notes (from perplexity.ai)

### What is the recommended project structure for Python applications?

In the project structure, the `setup.py` file would typically be placed in the
root directory of the project, alongside the main module `main.py`. The
`setup.py` file is used for packaging and distributing your Python project.

Here is an updated example of the project structure with the `setup.py` file
included:

```
parstats/
├── setup.py
├── arstats/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── module1/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── module1.py
│   └── module2/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── module2.py
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── test_module1.py
│   └── test_module2.py
└── testdata/
    ├── data1.json
    └── data2.csv
```

In this structure, the `setup.py` file is placed in the root directory of the
project, alongside the `myproject` directory. The `myproject` directory
contains the main module `main.py` and the subdirectories for different
components of the application, such as `module1` and `module2`. The `tests`
directory contains test modules, and the `testdata` directory contains non-Python
data.

The `setup.py` file is used to define the metadata and dependencies of your
project, as well as specify how to install and distribute it. It typically
imports the necessary functions from the setuptools module and uses them to
define the project's details, such as the name, version, author, and
dependencies. It can also specify entry points, which can be used to refer to
the main module `main.py` in your project.

Here is an example of how the `setup.py` file can refer to the main module
`main.py` using an entry point:

```python
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name='myproject',
    version='1.0',
    author='Your Name',
    packages=['myproject'],
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'myproject = myproject.main:main'
        ]
    }
)
```
In this example, the `entry_points` section specifies a console script named
"myproject" that will be created when the project is installed. It points to
the "main" function in the "main.py" module of the "myproject" package.

By placing the "setup.py" file in the root directory of your project and
specifying the appropriate entry points, you can easily distribute and install
your Python application using tools like pip.
